## Implementation Plan

1. [x] Rush for a js version for agent to deliver asap
1. [x] Align parser and output with clarified spec
1. [x] Replace `JEST` with `MOCHA` to enable step-in debugging
1. [x] Conduct further tests on edge cases
1. ~~[ ] Port the program into Ruby to learn the language~~

## Remark

If this is not an technical test,
I think I try a few libraries [here](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=topological%20sort) instead of implementing them myself.
