## Q.
>>>
I need clarity on the sample input.
A.          Can I assume the input are multiline strings ?

B.          Can I assume the tasks are always single character?

I am currently rushing a solution in typescript. Could it be helpful if I also code the task in Ruby?
>>>

## A.
>>>
Input; A string that looks something like this; 'a=>b,c=>d' - feel free to support multiline and yes, always single character.

As for 2, I'd say don't rush a solution, and to take his time with the typescript one.
